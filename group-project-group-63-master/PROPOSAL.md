# Group 63 Project Proposal
## The Impact of COVID-19 on Public Transport in the Greater Sydney Region
### Summary of the project
Since the beginning of 2020, the novel coronavirus, otherwise known as COVID-19, has spread rampantly around the world. To help manage the spread of the virus, communities, including Sydney, have had to make dramatic changes to the way they live such as incorporating social distancing measures and statewide lockdowns. The combination of these restrictions has had an obvious impact on the general public's use of the public transport system. This project plans to look into the impact that COVID-19 has had on the Sydney transport system which will assist in developing a prediction model to help understand when things may go back to normal.

### Goals of the project
The goals of the project are as follows:
- Analysing whether lockdown regulations had a negative impact on the use of public transport 
- Analysis into which mode of public transport had a greater decrease in usage over the pandemic period
- Understanding trends between different regions and looking for relationships between public transport usage and socio-economic status
- Exploring different machine learning models for predicting the future of public transport usage in the metropolitan area


### Datasets used in the analysis
For this project we plan to use the following datasets:
- From [Open Data Transport NSW](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/opal-patronage) we will use the Patronage tap on and tap off data from the last 12 months for the following areas:
    - Chatswood
    - Macquarie Park
    - North Sydney
    - Parramatta
    - Strathfield
    - Sydney CBD
- From [Data NSW](https://data.nsw.gov.au/data/dataset) we will analyse the COVID-19 cases throughout NSW which includes details on the total number of cases for each day as well as the postcode in which these cases were recorded.
- From the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/2033.0.55.0012016?OpenDocument) we will use the Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas data for analysis of the socio-economic statuses of the 6 areas of Sydney mentioned above.

### Techniques
For this project, we plan to use a linear regression model which will be used to help predict the rate at which public transport will go back to normal. Additionally, we will test this regression model up against a nerual network to help with finding the most accurate model and thus, have th emost accurate prediction of when things will return to normal. 

### Project Plan
- End of mid-semester break the plan is to have completed the scraping of data from the internet and cleaning of data

- End of week 8 the plan is to have completed all correlation testing

- End of week 10 the plan is to have completed all prediction models

- End of week 12 will have a presentation completed and final project ready for submission
